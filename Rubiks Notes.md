## Rubiks Cube

### Modifications to Gameplay Interface

A new command `play` has been added: 

`play rubiks` initializes a Rubik's Cube.

`play 8puzzle` initializes an 8-puzzle.


## TODO

* the CLI/file interface + downstream code (e.g.applyCommand) needs to know about side
* stringToMove methods should throw exceptions instead of returning null
